CHANGELOG
=========

*  **07/12/20** Worked on RTE and adding images.
*  **06/12/20** Worked on Working with content page, create content page.
*  **30/11/20** Worked on Creating pages page, access control, visibility and frontend login.
*  **23/11/20** Worked on Translation page to edit it and update images. Also
   modified Next Steps, and removed x-ref from the TOC
*  **17/11/20** More work on Page Properties. Ugh, it's bigger than Ben Hur.
   Took a break on that and moved the 'Other features' content into the Working
   with Pages content. Removed the other features because it was only one
   feature and it was about filtering the page tree. Added new folder
   'PagePropertiesNonStandard' to house the info for properties for other page
   types.
*  **16/11/20** Page Properties. Updated the information for v10. Edited. New
   screenshots. Still in draft - asked question on Slack.
*  **10/11/20** Pages and Working with Pages - Reverted my changes. Decided
   against such a drastic structual change. And I want to keep it simple
   so that I can backport the work on pages in the page tree. Swapped pages and
   content elements in the toc. Edited the Working with Pages page. Created new
   images.
*  **09/11/20** Pages and Working with Pages - Renamed. I wanted the Pages file
   (that houses the TOC) to be called Working with Pages. The Working with
   Pages file contained information about the page tree, so I named it Pages
   in the Page Tree. Edited these pages. There is cross-over with the Getting
   Started and it's hard to know where to draw the line on my work. I think I
   will stop here and work on the Getting Started in a subsequent piece of
   work.
*  **08/11/20** Page Types - edited.
*  **04/11/20** Login - edited. Renamed to Help inside TYPO3. Updated in TOC.
   Updated the images. Removed the login information since it's already in the
   Getting Started tutorial.
*  **01/11/20** Introduction - edited. Renamed to 'About'. Moved to root folder
   and deleted Introduction folder. Added to TOC.
*  **30/10/20** Index.rst - changed from Tutorial to Guide. Updated the
   Mainzific URL. Renamed. Added Draft message to top of page.

## Initial workflow
I'm starting at page 1 and working consecutively.


## Open questions
* Index.rst - what to do about `Previous Key: doc_tut_editors`?
