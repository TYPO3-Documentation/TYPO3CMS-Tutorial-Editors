# CHANGELOG

## Plan
The plan for overhauling this doc is in a Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FQjzWSSqP6BL4BsSa3_TpjBQUzB0ZxRbvjnuUZ9CfKk/edit#gid=485539181

## Initial workflow
I'm starting at page 1 and working consecutively.

## CHANGELOG
* Index.rst - changed from Tutorial to Guide. Updated the Mainzific URL. Renamed. Added Draft message to top of page.
*

## Open questions
* Index.rst - what to do about `Previous Key: doc_tut_editors`?
