CHANGELOG
=========

* **10/11/20** Pages and Working with Pages - Reverted my changes. Decided
against such a drastic structual change. And I want to keep it simple
so that I can backport the work on pages in the page tree. Swapped pages and
content elements in the toc. Edited the Working with Pages page. Created new
images.
* **09/11/20** Pages and Working with Pages - Renamed. I wanted the Pages file
(that houses the TOC) to be called Working with Pages. The Working with Pages
file contained information about the page tree, so I named it Pages in the
Page Tree. Edited these pages. There is cross-over with the Getting Started
and it's hard to know where to draw the line on my work. I think I will stop
here and work on the Getting Started in a subsequent piece of work.
* **08/11/20** Page Types - edited.
* **04/11/20** Login - edited. Renamed to Help inside TYPO3. Updated in TOC.
Updated the images. Removed the login information since it's already in the
Getting Started tutorial.
* **01/11/20** Introduction - edited. Renamed to 'About'. Moved to root folder
and deleted Introduction folder. Added to TOC.
* **30/10/20** Index.rst - changed from Tutorial to Guide. Updated the
Mainzific URL. Renamed. Added Draft message to top of page.

## Plan
The plan for overhauling this doc is in a Google Sheet:

## Initial workflow
I'm starting at page 1 and working consecutively.

## Open questions
* Index.rst - what to do about `Previous Key: doc_tut_editors`?
