About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a short tutorial for editors.

It first shows you how to log in to TYPO3. TYPO3 has a page tree with
the pages, which you can see when you visit your website. On these
pages you have content elements, which contain the content, which is
present on each page. As an editor you will create and edit content
elements and pages.

This tutorial begins with the tasks, which an editor needs most
frequently: Editing existing and creating new content. The following
chapters will explain how to edit and create pages. Finally there is a
short introduction on working with translations.

The tutorial provides the most basic instructions step-by-step.
It does not cover all available functions, but the most common ones.
