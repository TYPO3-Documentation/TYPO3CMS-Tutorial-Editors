About this document
===================

This is a short tutorial for editors. It explains how to create
pages and content elements. It also details the various types
of pages and content elements.

This tutorial starts with the tasks which an editor most frequently needs:
editing existing content and creating new one. We will then move on to editing
and creating pages. Then comes a short introduction to working with translations.
Finally the tutorial presents the various access restriction
concepts: visibility, publication time and password-protected pages.

The tutorial provides the most basic instructions step-by-step.
It does not cover all available functions, but the most common ones.

It is assumed that you have been through the
:ref:`Getting Started Tutorial <t3start:start>` and are thus
familiar with the general concepts of TYPO3 CMS, in particular
the separation of frontend and backend.
