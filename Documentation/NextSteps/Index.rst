If you need more information on how to translate a web site, you should
read the :doc:`Localization Guide <t3l10n:Index>`. It contains
information on how to set up a multi-language site and how to actually
do the translation and localization.

If your activities are not limited to editorial work,
you may want to further learn about TYPO3 CMS by following
the :doc:`TypoScript in 45 minutes Tutorial <t3ts45:Index>`
which is a preparation for the :doc:`Templating Tutorial <t3templating:Index>`.
