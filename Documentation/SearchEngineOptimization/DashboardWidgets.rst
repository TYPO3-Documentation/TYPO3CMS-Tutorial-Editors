"Missing Meta Description" widget
=================================

To make it more convenient for TYPO3 editors to optimize their website for search
engines, :composer:`typo3/cms-seo` offers a dashboard widget that shows pages without
a meta description.

The description field is important for SEO purposes. This field is used to
instruct search engines to use this text to show as a teaser of your page in
the search result snippets. With this description, you can give the user a
clear overview of the topic of this page:
