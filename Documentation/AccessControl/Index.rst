Access Control
==============

Access control is about visibility of content on your website.

There are many ways to restrict access to pages, content elements
and other information in your TYPO3 CMS installation. Options can range from
hiding pages in menus, to limiting visibility of content for a set time
period, all the way through to requiring visitors to log in to view content.

These various options are presented in this chapter.

.. container:: row m-0 p-0

   .. container:: col-md-6 pl-0 pr-3 py-3 m-0

      .. container:: card px-0 h-100

         .. rst-class:: card-header h3

            .. rubric:: :ref:`Visibility<visibility>`

         .. container:: card-body

            When an element is hidden, be it a page, a content element or a news item,
            it will not display in the frontend. You can, however, preview it in the backend.

   .. container:: col-md-6 pl-0 pr-3 py-3 m-0

      .. container:: card px-0 h-100

         .. rst-class:: card-header h3

            .. rubric:: :ref:`Frontend Login<frontend-login>`

         .. container:: card-body

            Find out how to configure content and pages to only be visible
            to frontend users who have logged in to a restricted area.
