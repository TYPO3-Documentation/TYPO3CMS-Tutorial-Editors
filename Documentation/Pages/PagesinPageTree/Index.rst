Pages in the Page Tree
======================

You can create, move, hide and delete pages by working directly in the page
tree.

   :alt: Working in the page tree with drag and drop

#. Click on the "new page" icon to display icons corresponding to the various
   page types. Drag and drop any of these icons to the page tree to create
   a new page of that type.

#. To move an existing page, grab the page title (not the icon!) and drop it
   anywhere in the page tree.

#. The page tree shows the point where the page will be inserted once
   you drop it. A bubble help displays information about possible
   actions options (i.e. copy instead of move)

#. This page is being copied. Note the page highlighted with the light blue
   background. If the page is dropped now, it will become of child of that
   page.

#. Move a page to the bottom of the screen to display the "delete" zone.
   Drop the page there to delete it. There is no confirmation dialog box,
   but the "delete" zone offers the option to undo.


.. note::

   A variety of functions are also available from the context menu, as
   explained in the :ref:`Getting Started Tutorial <t3start:the-context-menu>`.
