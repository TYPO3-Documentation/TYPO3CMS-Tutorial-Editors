* Metadata
* Appearance
* Behaviour
* Resources

.. _pages-properties-titles:

General
=======

This tab contains general information about the page. You
can change the :guilabel:`Page Type`, and edit titles for the page and the URL.

The :guilabel:`Page Title` is used directly to generate speaking URLs. It is
also used in menus and in the `<title>` tag.

When you specify an :guilabel:`Alternative Navigation Title` all other
instances of :guilabel:`Page Title` usage are left unchanged.

   The **Appearance** tab of the page properties

Backend layouts determine what content areas are made available for editors
in the :guilabel:`Web > Page` module. They can also be used to influence the
rendering of the frontend.

The :guilabel:`Show Content from Page` field tells the page to display the
content from another selected page. This is an easier method for repeating
the content of a single page than using :ref:`mount points <pages-types>`.

.. _pages-properties-behaviour:

Behaviour

This tab influences a variety of different aspects of the page.

Link Target
   Set the default Link Target for menu items linking to the page. You can
   also specify for the page to open in a new window.

  in the page tree is replaced by a world icon (as displayed for the
  "Congratulations" page of the Introduction Package).

  search engine :ref:<indexed_search>. Use this flag to
  exclude the current page.

  rendering in page tree of the backend. This can be useful if you have a
  lot of subpages.
