There are two ways to add a new page to your site. It can be done either by dragging the new page
icon to the desired location in the page tree or by right-clicking on
an existing page and using the contextual menu.

To start adding pages:

* Select the :guilabel:`Web > Page` module in the backend.
* Expand the page tree so that all of its subpages are visible (optional).


.. _pages-creating-tree:

Adding pages within the page tree
=================================

You can create a new page by dragging and dropping a page from the top of
the page tree.

#. Select the type of page you want to add by choosing from one of the icons. In this example
   we are creating a standard page.

#. Drop the icon either between two existing pages to create a sibling
   or on top of an existing page to create a child.

#. Give the new page a title.

New pages are disabled by default. To enable a newly created page, right-click on the page
and select :guilabel:`Enable`. You can also enable a page from the :guilabel:`Access` tab in page properties.


.. _pages-creating-context:

Adding pages with the context menu
==================================

#. Right-click any existing page and choose :guilabel:`More options > 'Create
   New' Wizard` from the context menu.
