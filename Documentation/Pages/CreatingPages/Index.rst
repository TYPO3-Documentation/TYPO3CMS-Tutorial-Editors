Creating Pages
==============

There are two main ways to add a new page to your site.

First make sure that you currently are in a **WEB** module
so that you see the page tree.


.. _pages-creating-tree:

Adding pages within the page tree
=================================

As we saw before, you can create a new page by dragging and
dropping a page type from the top of the page tree.

#. Choose a page type by selecting one of the icons (here a standard page,
   see the :ref:`Page types chapter <pages-types>`).

#. Drop the icon either between two existing pages (will create a sibling)
   or on an existing page (will create a child).

#. Insert a title for the new page

A new page is disabled by default. To enable a page, use the context menu or
the page properties.


.. _pages-creating-context:

Adding pages with the context menu
==================================

Click on the icon of any existing page and choose
"Page Actions > New" from the context menu.

You will be taken to the new page wizard, which asks you
to select a position for the new page.

After selecting a position, you will be taken to the form which
lets you define the properties of the new page. For now, let's
just set the title which is mandatory.

You may also want to move to the *Access* tab and
uncheck the "Disable" box, so that your new page is visible
in your web site.

More properties are explored in the :ref:`Page properties chapter <pages-properties>`.
