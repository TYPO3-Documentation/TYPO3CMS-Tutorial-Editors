By checking the **Place new pages after the existing subpages** box,
the new pages will be added below the currently existing subpages.
Otherwise they will be placed above the current pages.

You can choose to add more pages than proposed (5 by default)
by clicking on the "Add more lines" button.

Options **Hide new pages** and **Hide new pages in menus** let you
manage the visibility of your new pages.

.. tip::

   A hidden page cannot be accessed by anyone via the web site.
   A page which is hidden in menus does not appear in the site
   navigation but can be accessed by someone having the direct URL
   of that page.

Once you are done click the  **Create pages** button.
