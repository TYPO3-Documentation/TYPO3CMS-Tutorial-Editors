#. Give each new page a title and choose its type.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Add more lines` button to add five more new pages.

#. Configure the new pages using the options at the bottom of the screen:

   *  The :guilabel:`Place new pages after the existing subpages` option adds
      new pages below the currently existing subpages. Otherwise they will be
      placed above the current pages.

   *  The :guilabel:`Hide new pages` and :guilabel:`Hide new pages in menus`
      options let you manage the visibility of your new pages.

      A hidden page cannot be accessed by anyone via the web site. A page which
      is hidden in menus does not appear in the site navigation but can be
      accessed by someone having the direct URL  of that page.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Create pages` button to create the pages.
