Page types
==========

By default, TYPO3 CMS includes the following page types.

Page
====

Standard
  This is the default page type, and the most common. It covers all basic
  needs.

Backend User Section
  This page type only displays in the frontend for a specific group of backend
  users. You have to be logged in to the backend to see this type of page.

Link
====

Shortcut
  This page type is a shortcut to another page in the page tree. When users
  navigate to this page in the frontend, they will be taken seamlessly to the
  shortcut's destination.

Mount point
  A mount point lets you select any other page in the page tree. All
  child pages of the chosen page will display as child pages of the mount
  point. This lets you duplicate parts of your page tree in terms of
  navigation, without actually duplicating pages and content.

  See the :ref:`Mounts <coreapi:access-options-mounts>` section in TYPO3
  Explained for more information about mount points.

Link to External URL
  This page type is similar to the :guilabel:`Shortcut` type but leads the
  user to a page on another web site.

Special
=======

Folder
  A folder page type is a container. It is generally used to store records
  other than pages or content elements. It will not display in the frontend.

Recycler
  This is similar to the :guilabel:`Folder` type, but indicates that the
  content is meant for removal. There is no clean-up function, it is just a
  visual indicator.

Menu separator
  This page type creates a visual separation in the page tree. You can use
  TypoScript to also display these separators in the frontend navigation.
