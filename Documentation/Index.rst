TYPO3 Editors Guide
===================

Once you have installed TYPO3 using the :doc:`Getting Started Guide <t3start:Index>`;
the next step is to log in to the backend of the CMS and start adding pages and create
some content. In the TYPO3 world we often call users who carry out these tasks "Editors".

This guide contains detailed information about all of the common tasks an Editor
is likely to perform including granting other users access to the backend,
creating pages, adding content to pages in the form of content elements and
uploading and managing various file types including images and PDFs.

This guide assumes that you are already familiar with TYPO3. If this is not the case,
visit the :ref:`concepts of TYPO3<t3start:concepts>` to get started.

All of the examples used in this guide are taken from a TYPO3 installation running
the `Official Introduction Package <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/introduction/>`__.
