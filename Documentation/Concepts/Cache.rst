=====
Cache
=====

Computing a page to be displayed in the frontend requires time and resources.

Therefore TYPO3 (and many other CMS) uses a cache. That is a storage for
results of calculations.

If you display a page in the frontend TYPO3 first has a look if that page
can be found in the cache and was therefore already calculated. If the page
is found in the cache the previously calculated result is delivered right away.
If the page is not found in the cache it is generated by collecting data from
different sources and doing some calculations. Then the result is delivered to
the visitor and stored for future use.

.. _browser-cache:

Browser cache
=============

The browser on the client machine (Chrome, Edge, Firefox etc) also caches pages.
Sometimes you cannot see the changes you just made because your own browser
cached a previous content.

It depends on the browser and the operating system, how you can clear your
browsers cache.

On windows in most browsers you can press Strg + F5 to clear the browser cache.

Automatic cache clearing
=========================

The cache of a page is cleared automatically in the following cases:

*  You changed something about the page itself like its title
*  You changed a content of the page like a text or image on that page
*  In certain time intervals, usually once a day
*  If content with a starttime or endtime set becomes visible or invisible
*  In some other cases that your integrator or developer might have defined

Scenario: Changes are not visible in the frontend
==================================================

If the cache did not get automatically cleared, the changes you made might not
be visible right away in the frontend.

Some scenarios in which manual cache clearing might be necessary:

You changed the title of a page. You view the affected page and everything looks
fine. Now you go to the start page and cannot see your in the menu. The following
happened: Changing a pages title deletes the cache of the affected page. It
does, however, not delete the cache of other pages like the start page.

You added a news record. It does not appear in the news list. Creating a record
does not automatically delete the cache of any page unless the integrator made
some configurations.

You changed content on one page that should also be displayed on other pages.
This is often done with static parts of the page that should be editable
nevertheless such as footer, a carousel in the header etc.

Manual cache clearing
=====================

Clearing the cache of a single page can be done without ill effect in most
installations.

To clear the cache of that page, go to the module :guilabel:`Web > Page`
and click the button representing a lightening bolt with the tooltip
:guilabel:`Clear Cache for this Page`.

   Clear Cache for this Page

When you reload the affected page the changes should be visible right away.
If the changes are not visible, also clear the :ref:`browser-cache`. Or use an
incognito tab in your browser.

Only editors who received the according user rights can flush the cache of
all pages. If you cannot see the lightening bold button beside the help menu
button in the toolbar you might not have the right to do that:

.. figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/Cache/ClearAllPageCaches.png
   :alt: Flush cache of all pages

   Flush cache of **all** pages

.. warning:: After flushing the cache each page has to be generated a new
   on the first request for that page. For this resources of the server such
   as processor and hard disc usage are needed. If to many pages have to
   generated at the same time generating them might take longer (maybe minutes
   instead of seconds) or fail all together. Therefore some TYPO3 installations
   do not allow manual cache flushing. Talk to you Administrator about the
   preferred strategy here.

Previewing a page without clearing the cache
=============================================

If you need to preview a page and cannot clear its cache you can use the
parameter :code:`no_cache=1` to preview the page as it will look once the
cache is cleared. For example open
:samp:`https://example.org/community/events?no_cache=1`.
