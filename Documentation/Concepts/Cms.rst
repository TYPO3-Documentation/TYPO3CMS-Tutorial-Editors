Separation of content and presentation
==============================

   Separation of content and presentation is the separation of concerns design
   principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content.

In TYPO3 the content in its raw form is edited in the backend, while the
presentation is achieved in the frontend:

In the backend, for example, you can state that a headline should have level
2. This would be a content decision. However, in the frontend this headline is
displayed in red and underlined. This is one example of what the presentation
does.

The presentation is influenced by the :doc:`sitepackage <t3sitepackage/Index>`
that your integrator or developer configured.
