Data privacy
============

In different countries there are different laws about data privacy. In general,
you may not publish pictures of or data from any person alive or dead unless

such as politicians, scientists or movie stars.

Personal data does not only include a persons name but each information that
might help to identify the person in question such as phone number, email
address, IP address, nick names, pictures, car license plates etc.

Wikipedia has a good article on `Personal Data <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data>`__
which explains the situation in different countries.

   Publishing personal information without consent might lead to high fines in
   some countries. If in doubt, do not use any personal information
   without consulting legal advice first.
