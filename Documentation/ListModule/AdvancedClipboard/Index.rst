Advanced clipboard usage
========================

Select a page, in the :guilabel:`List` view. If not activated, click on
:guilabel:`Show Clipboard` (1). Select
:guilabel:`"Clipboard #1 (multi-selection mode)"` in the clipboard panel on the
bottom of the page. You can now check all records (3) or check just the ones
you want to work on. Each record now has a checkbox.

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ListModule/ActivateClipboardPad.rst.txt

As soon as one or more records are checked, new buttons will appear at the top of the list:

#. :guilabel:`Edit` all selected items at once

#. :guilabel:`Transfer to Clipboard` all selected items at once

#. :guilabel:`Remove from Clipboard` all selected items at once

#. :guilabel:`Delete` all selected items at once

Now check several boxes and click the :guilabel:`Transfer to Clipboard` button.
Your clipboard should look like this:

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ListModule/ClipboardWithMultipleItems.rst.txt

The button :guilabel:`Move Elements`is selected by default. Select the button
:guilabel:`Copy Elements` instead. The selected elements will now be copied
and the current page will remain unchanged.

Move to another page and click the "Paste into" icon:

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ListModule/PasteClipboardContent.rst.txt

A warning appears to confirm the operation:

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ListModule/ClipboardWarning.rst.txt

After confirmation, you can see that the two elements have been moved
to the top of the list and that the clipboard pane is empty:
