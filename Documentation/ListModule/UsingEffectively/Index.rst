Introduction
============

The :guilabel:`Web > List` module allows you to browse through pages and folders
in your site and view the records that
are stored there. You can also create and edit records here outside of being in a
specific module.

Records stored on pages include sub pages, content elements and news articles.

=====================
Using the list module
=====================

Select the :guilabel:`Web > List` module and browse to the
"Congratulations" page. You should see the following:

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ListModule/ListModule.rst.txt

The list view displays a list of records stored on the
current page, grouped by type. The name which appears on a record
depends on which field is used for the label. For "pages", the field is
"Pagetitle".

The list view has action icons in the **Docheader** including:

1. **Create** a new record (a wizard appears to let you choose which type)

2. **View** the current page (in the frontend)

3. **Edit** the current page

4. **Search** the current page

5. **Clear the cache** of the current page

6. **Refresh** the List view

7. **Bookmark** this view

8. **Copy URL** of this view

9. Access **contextual help** (removed with version 12.0)

Action icons are also available in the **Content Area**:

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/ListModule/ListModuleContentArea.rst.txt


#. Create a **new page record**

#. Action icons for the record. Which icons appear here depends on the record
   type selected. If the record is viewable in the frontend (as "pages" are), a "View"
   icon is displayed. All records have the three icons
   "Edit", "Hide/unhide" (i.e. visible in the frontend or not) and "Delete".

   The ellipsis icon (three consecutive dots) expands the icon list to show
   additional action icons (typically used for accessing information, moving around, etc.)

   There are also cut and paste icons.

Now, make sure that the :guilabel:`Show clipboard` box is checked, as we
will explore this next.
