------------

On a page, click the pencil icon for the content element you want to edit,
then edit the text and make other changes as required.

You can also change the content element type by selecting a new element from
the :guilabel:`Type` list.

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/EditContent/EditContentChangeType.rst.txt

When you change a content element's type, the TYPO3 CMS reloads the screen to
display different input fields.

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/EditContent/EditContentChangeTypeConfirm.rst.txt

This action does not delete content. It is saved in the background and will be
restored if you select the applicable content element type again.

.. tip::

   If you are more comfortable using shortcuts, there are different kinds of
   :ref:`keyboard commands <t3editors:keyboard_commands>` you can use in
   the Backend Editor.
