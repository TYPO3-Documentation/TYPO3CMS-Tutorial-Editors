Editing Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The work area for editing content and for creating content is actually
the same. The only difference is that the form is already filled when
you edit an existing element. In this section you will find a
description of the different parts of the working area when working
with a  **text with image** content element. This covers both the
**text** and the  **images** content elements.

#. Close, Save, (+ preview, + close, + new record) delete this content element or undo last changes

#. General Settings are Type, Column and Language, depending on the type of content element there
   are different tabs. Switching between the tabs keeps changes. The top area contains the
   header of the element, as well as the type, which you can change. Be aware that changing a
   text with image element to a text element will cause it to loose all pictures.
