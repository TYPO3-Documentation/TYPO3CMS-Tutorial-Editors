====================
The rich text editor
====================

The TYPO3 text editing interface is not much different from a word processor.
The options available in the toolbars vary depending on how your TYPO3
installation is configured.

You can format text, set the alignment, insert tables and symbols and add
internal and external links to text.

This window lets you link to an internal page, file, folder, external
URL, email address or phone number.

Internal links
--------------
You can link to an internal file, folder, page or content element on a page.

On the **Page** tab, select the page in the page tree that you want to link to.

Alternatively, you can link to a specific point (anchor) on the page. Browse
to the page you want to link to, then click the arrow icon next to the page
name. The content elements on that page are displayed and you can select the
content element you want to link to.

#. Type your link in the :guilabel:`URL` field.

   link in a new browser window.
