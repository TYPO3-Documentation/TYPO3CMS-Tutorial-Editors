Types of content elements
=========================

The content elements you can see here are provided by a standard TYPO3
installation with a site package as described in the
`TYPO3 site package tutorial <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3sitepackage:start>`_.

If you are working with a different setup you might see more, or different
content elements.

Which content elements you can see as an editor also depends on your user rights:

A standard editor can see the following content elements:

Content elements seen by a typical TYPO3 editor

Lists
-----

Lists can be used for structured content. They provide less flexibility then
standard content elements but are easier to use for their specialized use case.
