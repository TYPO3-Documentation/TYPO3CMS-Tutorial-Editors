Help within TYPO3 CMS
=====================

Before we dive further into using TYPO3 CMS it is useful to remember
that quite some help is available straight inside the backend:

- A very short description of buttons or functions appears if you hover
  with your mouse pointer over it.

- When editing a record, hover over its label. If your cursor changes into
  a question mark, you can click on the label to get a help pop-up.

- You will often see the following a **question mark icon** next to an element. Hovering over
  it will pop up a little help window about the item or function it is next to:

  help section.
