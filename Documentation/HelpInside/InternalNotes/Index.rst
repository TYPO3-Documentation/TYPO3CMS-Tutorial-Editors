===================================
Internal notes in the TYPO3 backend
===================================

..  note::
    These are only available if :composer:`typo3/cms-sys-note` is installed
    and your administrator granted you the necessary user rights.

Internal notes, also called system notes, are small text notes that are
displayed in the `Page module <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3editors:content-creating>`_
and `List module <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3editors:using-the-list-module-effectively>`_.

You can use them to write notes to yourself or other editors. Administrators
can use them to write notes to you as well.

They look like this:

    If you have sufficient permissions you can also edit or delete the note.

    The following image shows a detailed view of the TYPO3 backend toolbar, specifically in
    the context of the "Page" or "List" module. On the right side of the toolbar are a number
    of buttons, each providing different functionality. The button highlighted in this screenshot
    is which allows the user to create a new internal note.
