Backend search
==============

The backend search tool accepts text and searches against
various types of records in the backend.

The search can be opened by selecting the magnifying glass in the top right
corner of the toolbar or - starting with TYPO3 v12 - by hitting :kbd:`cmd + k`
twice in a row.
